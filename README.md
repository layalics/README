# US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project
in this project we used python to explor the data .

# File used 
bikeshare_2.py

# How it works:
The code will be developed to accommodate initial input to create an interactive experience in the device that answers questions about the dataset. There are four questions that will change the outcome:

1- Did you choose the data that you want to see (Chicago, New York, Washington)?
2-Filter Data by month, day, or not at all?
- (If they choose the month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
- (If they choose today) What day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?

Answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe in which you will conduct the data analysis. After filtering the data set, users will see the statistical result for the data, and choose to start over or exit.
